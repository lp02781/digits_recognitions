Training_2.4.1_modified.ipynb - > modified from ipynb before

	Unfortunely Training_2.4.1.ipynb (same as link in eclass) is to build a 
	binary classifier (True and False) to distinguish between the digits 3 and 6.

	it couldn't use to classification digits from captured image.

	so I modified the code so in Training_2.4.1_modified.ipynb to classify digits 
	from captured image using Classical model like in Training_2.4.1.ipynb
	because Classical model has the best accuracy than 2 other models.
